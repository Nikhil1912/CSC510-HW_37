| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate system running on their computer) | 2          | A few files have 3/4 contributors, suggesting most members can run them; e.g. see Num.py [here](https://github.com/Lamonkey/csc510_hw/blob/main/code/Num.py)                                                                     |
